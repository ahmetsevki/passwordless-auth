# Passwordless Auth

This stack allows a user to login directly via email without any need for a pasword. This uses Cognito for authentication along with Lambda triggers.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

- `yarn watch` watch for changes and compile
- `yarn test` perform the jest unit tests
- `yarn cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `yarn cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
